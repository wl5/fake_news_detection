Hundreds of Palestinians flee floods in Gaza as Israel opens dams,Hundreds of Palestinians were evacuated from their homes Sunday morning after Israeli authorities opened a number of dams near the border flooding the Gaza Valley in the wake of a recent severe winter storm.The Gaza Ministry of Interior said in a statement that civil defense services and teams from the Ministry of Public Works had evacuated more than 80 families from both sides of the Gaza Valley (Wadi Gaza) after their homes flooded as water levels reached more than three meters.Gaza has experienced flooding in recent days amid a major storm that saw temperatures drop and frigid rain pour down.The storm displaced dozens and caused hardship for tens of thousands including many of the approximately 110000 Palestinians left homeless by Israel's assault over summer.The suffering is compounded by the fact that Israel has maintained a complete siege over Gaza for the last eight years severely limiting electricity and the availability of fuel for generators. It has also prevented the displaced from rebuilding their homes as construction materials are largely banned from entering.Gaza civil defense services spokesman Muhammad al-Midana warned that further harm could be caused if Israel opens up more dams in the area noting that water is currently flowing at a high speed from the Israel border through the valley and into the Mediterranean sea.Evacuated families have been sent to shelters sponsored by UNRWA the UN agency for Palestinian refugees in al-Bureij refugee camp and in al-Zahra neighborhood in the central Gaza Strip.The Gaza Valley (Wadi Gaza) is a wetland located in the central Gaza Strip between al-Nuseirat refugee camp and al-Moghraqa. It is called HaBesor in Hebrew and it flows from two streams -- one whose source runs from near Beersheba and the other from near Hebron.Israeli dams on the river to collect rainwater have dried up the wetlands inside Gaza and destroyed the only source of surface water in the area.Locals have continued to use it to dispose of their waste for lack of other ways to do so however creating an environmental hazard.This is not the first time Israeli authorities have opened the Gaza Valley dams.In Dec. 2013 Israeli authorities also opened the dams amid heavy flooding in the Gaza Strip. The resulting floods damaged dozens of homes and forces many families in the area from their homes.In 2010 the dams were opened as well forcing 100 families from their homes. At the time civil defense services said that they had managed to save seven people who had been at risk of drowning.,1

Spider burrowed through tourist's stomach and up into his chest,Fear not arachnophobes the story of Bunbury's spiderman might not be all it seemed.Perth scientists have cast doubt over claims that a spider burrowed into a man's body during his first trip to Bali. The story went global on Thursday generating hundreds of stories online.Earlier this month Dylan Thomas headed to the holiday island and sought medical help after experiencing a really burning sensation like a searing feeling in his abdomen.Dylan Thomas says he had a spider crawl underneath his skin.Thomas said a specialist dermatologist was called in and later used tweezers to remove what was believed to be a tropical spider.But it seems we may have all been caught in a web... of misinformation.Arachnologist Dr Volker Framenau said whatever the creature was it was almost impossible for the culprit to have been a spider.If you look at a spider the fangs the mouth parts they have they are not able to burrow. They can't get through skin he said.We thought it may have been something like a mite there are a few different parasitic mites out there which can sometimes look a bit like a spider. I can't think of any spider which could do this to a person.Dr Mark Harvey from the Western Australian Museum agreed and said he found the case bizarre.I must confess I was amazed because I've never heard of a spider being able to survive under the skin of a human or indeed any mammal he said.Spiders need air to breathe they have spiracles on the sides of their bodies where air comes into their system through a series of what we call book lungs. Being under the skin of somebody I would have thought they wouldn't have enough air to survive.Even if it was a mite I've never seen anything like this. Even if it was an insect I've never heard of an insect crawling under the skin like this so it really is a remarkable case.Dr Harvey said spiders were widely feared in the community and often were the subject of urban legends.We hear about people going on holidays and having spiders lay eggs under the skin. Then [the baby spiders] burst out when they return from their holiday in the tropics he said.None of those are true they're just made up stories.They're not actually able to dig through the skin that's why this case is so unusual. Some can burrow into soil but they have to remove soil particles one at a time if they want to do that.Something which is true according to Dr Harvey is that certain arachnids do live on humans.We all have mites living on our faces. They're follicle mites but they're absolutely miniscule and you can't see them. We transmit them to our children when we have kids he said.They live in the bases of hair follicles on our faces and in some of the pores in our skin. Those mites are so small you can't see them and they're not going to cause a blemish on the skin like this lad has on his stomach.Dr Framenau said that much of the confusion could be eliminated by keeping or catching the creepy crawly offender dead or alive and enlisting the help of experts.It would be great if they collected it or took a photo of it he said.If you have been bitten by something the best thing you can do is collect it and submit it to a museum for identification before these things go viral.Dylan Thomas has been contacted for comment.- WA Today,2

Accused Boston Marathon Bomber Severely Injured In Prison May Never Walk Or Talk Again,A British fighter who travelled to Iraq to stop the Islamic State claims the terror group fed a murdered kidnap victim to his own mother after she went to their headquarters and demanded to see him.Yasir Abdulla a security guard from Keighley West Yorkshire decided to go to Iraq and fight against ISIS after hearing they came within six miles of taking control of his home village in Kurdistan which he left in 2000.It has been reported that the 36-year-old bought a set to combat fatigues online for £100 before going to Kurdistan and buying an assault rifle.From Yorkshire to Iraq: Security guard Yasir Abdulla (left near his home and right patrolling the border of his home town of Sheikhan Iraq) joined hundreds of fighters trying to stop the spread of ISISOn patrol: Mr Abdulla (right) pictured with an Islamic State fighter who he and others had detainedHe then joined hundreds of other Kurdish and Peshmerga forces who are trying to stop the spread of ISIS by patrolling a ten-mile front line in Iraq.Mr Abdulla returned to the UK last week but told The Sun how an elderly Kurdish woman whose son was captured by ISIS and taken to Mosul went to meet the jihadis to try and secure his release and was then fed his body.Slaughter: Mr Abdulla with a member of ISIS who he said was killed after he beheaded a KurdThe father of four told the newspaper: 'She was determined to find her son and went to ISIS headquarters and asked to see him.'The ISIS men told her to sit down because she had travelled a long way and said she should have some food before they took her to meet her son.'They brought her cups of tea and fed her a meal of cooked meat rice and soup. She thought they were kind.'But they had killed him and chopped him up and after she finished the meal and asked to see her son they laughed and said You've just eaten him.'During his time on the front line Mr Abdulla revealed how ISIS are terrorising locals by calling them and threatening to kidnap them and bury them alive unless they surrender.He also told of how the terror group kill prisoners they capture by throwing them on a 'human bonfire' and that he saw his own cousin killed in an ISIS attack.But despite returning back to his family in Yorkshire Mr Abdulla is keen to go back to Kurdistan saying he wants to finish the job in defeating ISIS.The new details about the cruelty of ISIS come as Iraq's prime minister called on tribal fighters to abandon the jihadis ahead of an offensive to retake Saddam Hussein's hometown of Tikrit from extremists.Haider al-Abadi offered no timeline for an attack on Tikrit 80 miles north of Baghdad which fell into the hands of ISIS last summer.Taking aim: With the flag of the Kurds on the back of his weather-beaten truck Mr Abdullah fires at ISISProud Kurd: Mr Abdulla said Islamists threaten to kidnap locals and bury them alive if they do not surrenderISIS and Al Qaeda are hiding messages to their followers in digitally-altered eBay photos and even pornography a book claims.Investigative journalist Gordon Thomas said Al Qaeda has used the tactic of 'steganography' - concealing messages in audio clips or images widely available online - to encode items listed for sale on the auction site.It works by manipulating a sound waveform or the order of pixels in a small or invisible part of an image a process not unlike the way teletext used to be delivered on analogue TVs.Now Israeli intelligence service Mossad believes ISIS militants are doing the same according to Mr Thomas.One intelligence source told him messages are often hidden on Reddit or 'X-rated pornographic pictures which conceal documents and orders for the next target'.The claims are contained within new chapters of Mr Thomas' book Gideon's Spies an extract of which was published yesterday by the New York Post.However Shiite militias and Iraqi security forces have stationed themselves around Tikrit as state-run media has warned that the city 'will soon return to its people.'Tikrit which occasionally saw attacks on U.S. forces during the American occupation of the country is one of the biggest cities held by ISIS.It also sits on the road to Mosul Iraq's second-largest city which is also held by the extremists.It has also been revealed that in February alone violence across Iraq killed at least 1100 Iraqis including more than 600 civilians according to the the UN Assistance Mission in Iraq.UN envoy Nickolay Mladenov blamed the deaths on the extremist group government forces and pro-government Shiite militias.He explained: 'Daily terrorist attacks perpetrated by ISIS continue to deliberately target all Iraqis.'There also concerning reports of a number of revenge killings by armed groups in areas recently liberated from ISIS.'Last year was the deadliest in Iraq since its 2006-2007 sectarian bloodshed with a total of 12282 people killed and 23126 wounded according to the UN.Pro-ISIS supporters wave flags as they parade through Mosul in Iraq. A British fighter has told how a Kurdish mother whose son was kidnapped and murdered by the group was fed his body when she travelled to Mosul demanding to see himYasir Abdulla also says that ISIS fighters pictured terrorise locals by calling them on the phone and threatening to bury them alive unless they surrender to themISIS fighters burn tyres following clashes with Peshmerga forces in Mosul.

Identity of ISIS terrorist known as 'Jihadi John' reportedly revealed,Adding to Apple's iOS 8 launch troubles a report on Monday claims the operating system's Reset All Settings feature for hardware wiping user preferences also deletes data stored in iCloud Drive.As discovered by MacRumors the issue presents itself when iPhone and iPad users attempt to reset preferences via the device's Settings > General > Reset > Reset All Settings option. The feature allows users to troubleshoot possible iOS issues by reverting all system settings back to factory baselines.As OS X 10.10 Yosemite and subsequently iCloud Drive is not yet available for consumer download aside from Apple's public beta testing program the effects on consumers are non-existent. However with a large number of untrained public beta participants opting in to the service with iOS 8 the problem could become serious.According to the report one iPad user performed the reset and found his local iWork documents deleted which consequently wiped those same documents from the cloud when the tablet synced to iCloud. It appears only data from first-party apps connected to iCloud Drive are affected by the bug though not all users are seeing the issue play out as described.In some cases files are being delete upon syncing with iCloud while other data remains untouched. It is suggested that users back up iCloud Drive documents to a local computer prior to performing the Reset All Settings operation.iCloud Drive is Apple's solution to cloud storage syncing and collaboration. The system allows seamless file transport and storage across iOS OS X and Windows while enabling advanced features like document editing asset tagging and drag-and-drop data management.Apple will activate iCloud Drive alongside the release of OS X Yosemite later this fall bringing the company's The feature has already rolled out to beta testers as well as the iCloud.com beta website which now supports access and editing of stored documents.,0
Banksy 'Arrested & Real Identity Revealed' Is The Same Hoax From Last Year,If you’ve seen a story floating around on your Facebook feed about Banksy getting arrested and exposed don’t worry because Banksy is still anonymous and well. The hoax was the work of a “satirical” news site called The National Report — which I’m not linking because f*ck those guys — that makes up fake stories that sound like they could be ostensibly true usually without a trace of actual satire as filthy filthy clickbait. It’s an awful yet unfortunately effective business model.In a story which was published early this morning The National Report claimed that Banksy was arrested in London by a 24-hour Anti-Graffiti Task Force and revealed to be a 35-year-old man named Paul Horner. The International Business Times did some quick fact checking and exposed the story to be a hoax:Paul Horner is the name given to a Facebook spokesperson who said the site will soon be charging users $2.99 a month – another hoax story that comes around every now and again – as well as the name from a hoax story about a 15-year-old Louisiana teen who was sentenced to 25 years to life after he called a SWAT team to another teenager’s house after he beat him while playing Battlefield 4.The article is also said to have been written by Dr Darius Rubics a fake name for a writer who claims to have be a Pulitzer-prize winning reporter but who unsurprisingly since his previous stories include ‘Obama Declares November National Muslim Appreciation Month’ and ‘Dennis Rodman Leaves US To Talk With Leaders Of Isis’ has never been awarded any prizes for excellence in journalism.HAHA get it? It’s funny because it’s not true! I guess there’s some logic in there somewhere. It’s not even entertaining to see people share stories that come from places like the The National Report since they’re designed to trick — unlike when dumb people share stories from The Onion which are designed to actually be satire. Again and I cannot stress this enough: F*ck those guys.,1
British Aid Worker Confirmed Murdered By ISIS,The British Islamic State militant who has featured in videos featuring the execution of Western hostages known as ‘Jihadi John’ has been identified.The man is Mohammed Emwazi a young British man from West London who was known to British security services.Security agencies did not disclose his name earlier due to operational reasons.Emwazi is thought to have killed American journalist James Foley in a video released last August.Read moreIslamic State militants behead missing American journalistHe is further believed to have featured in the videos of the beheadings of US journalist Steven Sotloff British aid worker David Haines British taxi driver Alan Henning and US aid worker Abdul-Rahman Kassig also known as Peter.Emwazi is reported to have links with a former UK control order suspect who fled to Somalia in 2006 and has alleged links to the funding of militant group Al Shabab which recently threatened to carry out terror attacks on London’s Oxford Street.He is a computing graduate from Queen’s Park in West London who traveled to Syria in 2012 and later joined the Islamic State (IS formerly ISIS).One of his friends told the Washington Post he had “no doubt” that “Mohammed is Jihadi John.”“He was like a brother to me … I am sure it is him. There was an extremely strong resemblance. This is making me feel fairly certain that this is the same person” he added.,0
